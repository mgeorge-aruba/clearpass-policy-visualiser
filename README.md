## Overview

ClearPass Policy Visualiser is a Flask-based visualisation and analysis platform for Aruba ClearPass Policy Manager.

It provides graphical visibility into the complete authentication and authorisation workflow, including:

- Services
- Authentication Sources
- Authorisation Sources
- Role Mapping Policies
- Role Mapping Rules
- Enforcement Policies
- Enforcement Profiles
- Enforcement Attributes
- Roles
- Endpoint Repository conditions

The Visualiser consolidates policy relationships, dependencies and enforcement actions into an interactive interface, allowing administrators to understand ClearPass configuration without navigating multiple areas of Policy Manager.

Additional capabilities include:

- Dependency analysis across ClearPass policy objects
- Unused object detection
- Enforcement Profile inspection
- Role Mapping and Enforcement Policy graph visualisation
- Endpoint Repository analysis
- Endpoint profiling visibility
- RADIUS-based user authentication
- Role-based application access
- Browser-based Initial Setup
- Configuration and connectivity validation
- Optional API-assisted ClearPass configuration
- Read-only ClearPass change review before provisioning
- Idempotent creation and validation of required ClearPass objects
- PostgreSQL endpoint profiling
- Read-only Impact Analysis for Enforcement Profiles
- Read-only Impact Analysis for Enforcement Policies
- Read-only Impact Analysis for Role Mapping Policies
- Read-only Impact Analysis for Roles
- Dashboard Impact Analysis Lookup across used, unused and built-in policy objects

The application uses ClearPass REST APIs secured with OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant for policy retrieval, analysis and optional configuration.

Users authenticate against ClearPass using RADIUS, with application permissions derived from returned role attributes such as `Aruba-User-Role`.

Endpoint profiling data is loaded directly from the ClearPass PostgreSQL database using the built-in `appexternal` account and the `tips_endpoint_profiles` table.

In the reference environment, PostgreSQL reduced endpoint fingerprint cache loading from approximately 74 seconds using the REST API to approximately 0.08 seconds.

## Features

### First-Run Initial Setup

ClearPass Policy Visualiser includes a browser-based Initial Setup workflow for configuring, validating and optionally provisioning the ClearPass integration.

When the application is started without an existing Visualiser configuration, Flask starts without initialising the ClearPass caches and redirects the administrator to Initial Setup.

The setup workflow configures:

- ClearPass REST API
- ClearPass REST API SSL certificate verification
- RADIUS authentication
- RADIUS shared secret
- NAS Identifier
- ClearPass PostgreSQL endpoint profiling
- Optional API-assisted ClearPass configuration

Sensitive fields require confirmation before validation. Configuration is validated before being persisted.

### Setup Connectivity Validation

Initial Setup performs connectivity validation before configuration is saved.

Validation includes:

- ClearPass server connectivity
- ClearPass REST API authentication
- PostgreSQL endpoint profiling connectivity

If the ClearPass server cannot be reached, the REST API authentication test is skipped rather than incorrectly reported as an authentication failure.

Validation results are displayed individually so administrators can distinguish between successful, failed and skipped tests. Failed setup attempts remain on the Initial Setup page and do not create a completed Visualiser configuration.

### API-Assisted ClearPass Configuration

ClearPass Policy Visualiser v1.3.0 adds an optional API-assisted configuration workflow to Initial Setup.

When **Automatically configure ClearPass for Policy Visualiser** is enabled, the Visualiser can create or validate the complete ClearPass authentication dependency chain:

1. `Visualiser-Admin` role
2. `Visualiser-Helpdesk` role
3. `visadmin` Local User
4. `vis-helpdesk` Local User
5. `Visualiser Admin access` Enforcement Profile
6. `Visualiser Helpdesk access` Enforcement Profile
7. `Visualiser Access Policy`
8. `Policy Visualiser` RADIUS Service

The provisioned Enforcement Profiles return:

```text
Aruba-User-Role = Admin
Aruba-User-Role = ReadOnly
```

The provisioned Enforcement Policy maps:

```text
Visualiser-Admin
        ↓
Visualiser Admin access
        ↓
Aruba-User-Role = Admin
```

and:

```text
Visualiser-Helpdesk
        ↓
Visualiser Helpdesk access
        ↓
Aruba-User-Role = ReadOnly
```

The provisioned RADIUS Service uses:

- `802.1X Wired` service template
- PAP authentication
- `[Local User Repository]`
- `MATCHES_ALL` service rules
- The configured Visualiser usernames
- The NAS Identifier entered during Initial Setup
- `Visualiser Access Policy`
- Enabled service state

The NAS Identifier is mandatory for assisted configuration. The value configured in the Visualiser must exactly match the NAS Identifier condition in the ClearPass Service.

#### ClearPass Change Review

The read-only **Review ClearPass Changes** operation reports each object as:

- `existing` - the object exists and matches the required configuration
- `would_create` - the object is missing and will be created
- `conflict` - the object exists but does not match the required configuration

Review uses an AJAX request, so entered secrets remain in the browser form. No ClearPass configuration changes are made during review.

When automatic configuration is enabled, a successful review is required before **Save and Continue** becomes available. Changing a relevant setup field invalidates the previous review.

#### Safety and Idempotence

The assisted configuration workflow is designed to preserve existing ClearPass configuration.

- Existing matching objects are validated and left unchanged.
- Existing Local User passwords are not reset.
- Passwords are required only when a Local User needs to be created.
- Local User passwords are not saved in `.visualiser.env`.
- Existing conflicting objects are not replaced or updated automatically.
- Missing objects are created in dependency order.
- Created objects are retrieved and verified after creation.
- Repeated provisioning is idempotent.
- Setup Complete reports which objects were created and which already existed.
- API-assisted configuration never deletes existing ClearPass objects.

### Configuration Management

Visualiser configuration created by Initial Setup is stored locally in:

```text
.visualiser.env
```

The application explicitly loads this file during startup. The legacy `config.yaml` configuration path has been removed, and the Visualiser application no longer implicitly loads application configuration from a conventional `.env` file. For Docker deployments, a project-level .env file may still be used by Docker Compose for deployment settings such as the container timezone.

```

The `.visualiser.env` file contains sensitive configuration and is excluded from Git.

### Service Visualisation

Visualise complete ClearPass service flows including:

- Authentication Sources
- Authorisation Sources
- Role Mapping Policies
- Role Mapping Rules
- Enforcement Policies
- Enforcement Profiles

### Interactive Policy Graph

Interactive graph features include:

- Zoom and pan
- Fit and Centre graph
- Reset layout
- Expandable and collapsible policy branches
- Node search
- Previous and Next search navigation
- Contextual object information
- Direct Impact Analysis links from Enforcement Profile nodes
- Direct Impact Analysis links from Enforcement Policy nodes
- Direct Impact Analysis links from Role Mapping Policy nodes
- Direct Impact Analysis links from mapped Role nodes
- PNG, JPG and SVG export

Unused Enforcement Policies and Role Mapping Policies can also be opened directly from the Unused Objects view and displayed using the policy graph.

Impact Analysis links open reports in a separate browser tab, preserving the current graph zoom, layout, branch expansion and selected-node state.

### Dashboard Impact Analysis Lookup

The dashboard provides a unified lookup for every ClearPass object supported by Impact Analysis.

The lookup indexes:
- Enforcement Profiles
- Enforcement Policies
- Role Mapping Policies
- Roles
- Used objects
- Unused objects
- ClearPass built-in objects

Lookup features include:
- Combined search across all supported object types
- Optional filtering by object type
- Case-insensitive substring matching
- Exact and prefix match prioritisation
- Object-type badges for similarly named results
- Keyboard navigation using the Up Arrow, Down Arrow, Enter and Escape keys
- Direct opening of the selected Impact Analysis report in a new browser tab
- Cache-only searches that do not call ClearPass for each typed character
- Automatic lookup cache rebuild during application startup and Refresh Cache

The lookup retains objects with the same name when the objects belong to different categories. Lookup identity is based on object type and case-insensitive object name.

### Repository Search

Directly analyse Endpoint Repository conditions referenced by Role Mapping Rules.

Features include:

- Matching endpoint counts
- Repository search
- Endpoint drill-down navigation
- Rule condition analysis

### Enforcement Profile Impact Analysis

ClearPass Policy Visualiser provides read-only dependency impact reporting for Enforcement Profiles.

Impact Analysis includes:

- Referenced and unreferenced usage classification
- Total affected Enforcement Policy count
- Total affected Service count
- Enforcement Profile ID, type, action and description
- Enforcement Profile attribute reporting
- Referencing Enforcement Policy names and IDs
- Enforcement Policy descriptions, where configured
- Policy-to-Service dependency relationships
- Deduplicated affected Service inventory
- Service IDs and direct navigation links
- Objective operational impact observations
- Support for rule-applied Enforcement Profiles
- Support for default Enforcement Profiles
- Support for system-defined Enforcement Profiles
- Dependency discovery for Enforcement Policies not currently assigned to a Service
- Direct Impact Analysis access from Enforcement Profile graph nodes
- Separate-tab report workflow that preserves the current graph state
- Reports can be downloaded as print-optimised PDF documents or complete structured JSON datasets

Impact Analysis distinguishes between:

- Enforcement Profiles that are not referenced by any Enforcement Policy
- Enforcement Profiles referenced only by policies that are not assigned to a Service
- Enforcement Profiles referenced by policies used across one or more Services

### Enforcement Policy Impact Analysis

Enforcement Policy Impact Analysis reports the complete operational scope of a selected Enforcement Policy.

The report includes:

- Assigned and Not Assigned usage classification
- Affected ClearPass Services
- Enforcement Policy ID, description and rule evaluation algorithm
- Policy rule and structured-condition inventory
- Positive Endpoint Repository match counts with direct Repository Search links
- Confirmed zero match counts without empty-result links
- Clear distinction between zero matches and unavailable match counts
- Unique dependent Enforcement Profile inventory
- Deduplication of Enforcement Profiles used by multiple rules
- Rule numbers associated with each dependent Enforcement Profile
- Rule-applied and default-profile classification
- Default Outcome when no policy rule matches
- Direct links to Enforcement Profile Impact Analysis
- Shared Enforcement Profile usage across other Enforcement Policies and Services
- Objective observations describing the discovered dependency scope
- Reports can be downloaded as print-optimised PDF documents or complete structured JSON datasets

The report is available from Service graphs, standalone Enforcement Policy graphs and Dashboard Impact Analysis Lookup.

### Endpoint Profiling

Endpoint profiling can display:

- Hostname
- Device Category
- Device Family
- Device Name
- Device Type
- Expanded Device Type
- MAC Vendor
- IPv4 Address

Endpoint profiling data is loaded directly from the ClearPass PostgreSQL database using the built-in `appexternal` account.

The PostgreSQL endpoint profiling cache is loaded during application startup. If PostgreSQL connectivity or authentication fails, cache initialisation stops and the Visualiser does not fall back to REST API endpoint profiling.

### Enforcement Profile Analysis

Provides detailed visibility into Enforcement Profile configuration and dependencies, including profile metadata, enforcement attributes and dependent policies and services.

### Role Mapping Policy Impact Analysis

Role Mapping Policy Impact Analysis reports how a selected Role Mapping Policy assigns Roles across ClearPass Services.

The report includes:

- Assigned and Not Assigned usage classification
- Affected ClearPass Services
- Role Mapping Policy ID, description and rule evaluation algorithm
- Mapping rule and structured-condition inventory
- Positive repository match counts with direct Repository Search links
- Confirmed zero match counts without empty-result links
- Clear distinction between zero matches and unavailable match counts
- Unique mapped Role inventory
- Deduplication of Roles assigned by multiple rules
- Rule numbers associated with each mapped Role
- Rule-assigned and default-Role classification
- Default Outcome when no mapping rule matches
- Role descriptions from the cached ClearPass Role inventory
- Objective observations describing the discovered assignment scope
- Reports can be downloaded as print-optimised PDF documents or complete structured JSON datasets

The report is available from Service graphs, standalone Role Mapping Policy graphs and Dashboard Impact Analysis Lookup.

### Role Impact Analysis

Role Impact Analysis reports where a selected ClearPass Role is referenced and the resulting policy and Service dependencies.

The report includes:

- Referenced and Not Referenced usage classification
- Role ID and description
- Referencing Role Mapping Policies
- Rule-assigned and default-Role references
- `Tips:Role` conditions in Role Mapping Policies
- `Tips:Role` conditions in Enforcement Policies
- Enabled Guest Operator Profile references
- Relevant rule numbers and conditions
- Deduplicated affected ClearPass Services
- Objective observations describing the discovered dependency scope
- Reports can be downloaded as print-optimised PDF documents or complete structured JSON datasets

The report is available from Dashboard Impact Analysis Lookup and mapped Role nodes in policy visualisations.

### Unused Object Analysis

Identifies ClearPass configuration objects that are no longer referenced, based on dependency analysis rather than name matching.

Detects unused:

- Enforcement Profiles, including default enforcement profiles
- Enforcement Policies
- Role Mapping Policies
- Roles

Role usage is resolved across Role Mapping Policies, assigned roles, default roles, `Tips:Role` conditions, Enforcement Policies and Guest Operator Profiles through the built-in `[Guest Roles]` mapping.

ClearPass built-in objects named with square brackets are automatically excluded. Each unused-object category provides a one-click **Copy All** option.

The Enforcement Profile unused count is intentionally strict. Only profiles with no Enforcement Policy references are counted as unused. Profiles referenced exclusively by policies that are not assigned to a Service are excluded from the unused count and remain visible through Impact Analysis. The Unused Objects interface includes an information tooltip explaining this distinction.

## Authentication and Data Sources

### ClearPass REST APIs

Service, Role Mapping, Enforcement Policy and Enforcement Profile data is retrieved using the ClearPass REST APIs.

When API-assisted configuration is enabled, the same integration is also used to inspect, create and verify the roles, Local Users, Enforcement Profiles, Enforcement Policy and RADIUS Service required by Policy Visualiser.

API authentication uses OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant:

```text
grant_type=client_credentials
```

The API client requires permissions appropriate to the data retrieval and optional configuration operations used by the Visualiser, including:

- Services
- Service configuration
- Authentication Sources
- Authorisation Sources
- Role Mapping Policies
- Enforcement Policies
- Enforcement Profiles
- Roles
- Local Users
- Guest Operator Profiles
- Endpoint Repository data

The ClearPass API client can be found or created under:

```text
Home › Administration › API Services › API Clients
```

### User Authentication

Users authenticate against ClearPass using RADIUS PAP authentication. The application supports role-based access using reply attributes including:

```text
Aruba-User-Role
Filter-Id
Class
```

| Aruba-User-Role | Application Role |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Admin | Administrator |
| ReadOnly | Read Only |

The required RADIUS server, port, shared secret and NAS Identifier are configured through Initial Setup.

### PostgreSQL Endpoint Profiling

Endpoint profiling information is loaded directly from the ClearPass PostgreSQL database using the built-in account:

```text
appexternal
```

The Visualiser queries:

```text
tips_endpoint_profiles
```

Use the External PostgreSQL Password configured on the Database tab.

Initial Setup requests the PostgreSQL host, port, database, username, password and password confirmation. The PostgreSQL connection is validated before setup can complete.

PostgreSQL access is required for endpoint profiling. If the PostgreSQL endpoint profiling cache cannot be loaded during application startup, cache initialisation stops rather than falling back to REST API endpoint profiling.

### Data Source Summary

| Function | Data Source | Authentication |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| User Login | ClearPass RADIUS | PAP |
| Service Discovery | ClearPass REST API | OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials |
| Authentication Sources | ClearPass REST API | OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials |
| Authorisation Sources | ClearPass REST API | OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials |
| Role Mapping Policies | ClearPass REST API | OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials |
| Enforcement Policies | ClearPass REST API | OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials |
| Enforcement Profiles | ClearPass REST API | OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials |
| Roles | ClearPass REST API | OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials |
| Local Users | ClearPass REST API | OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials |
| Guest Operator Profiles | ClearPass REST API | OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials |
| Endpoint Repository | ClearPass REST API | OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials |
| Endpoint Profiling Cache | PostgreSQL | `appexternal` |

## Python Dependencies

```text
Flask>=3.0.3
Flask-Login>=0.6.3
Flask-Limiter>=3.8.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.1
psycopg[binary]>=3.2.0
pyclearpass>=1.0.8
waitress>=3.0.2
```

PyYAML is not a direct production dependency because the legacy YAML configuration path has been removed.

---

## Requirements

### ClearPass Requirements

- Aruba ClearPass Policy Manager
- ClearPass REST API Client using OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant
- A ClearPass API Client with sufficient permissions to inspect and optionally create the required Policy Visualiser objects
- Network connectivity from the Visualiser host to ClearPass
- RADIUS configuration in ClearPass for Visualiser user authentication
- PostgreSQL access using the built-in `appexternal` account for endpoint profiling

### Docker Deployment

For Docker deployment:

- Docker Engine
- Docker Compose v2

Docker Desktop is the simplest installation option for Windows and macOS and includes Docker Engine, Docker CLI and Docker Compose.

Verify Docker and Docker Compose with:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

Python does not need to be installed on the host when running the Visualiser using Docker.

### Native Python Deployment

For native deployment without Docker:

- Python 3.11 or later
- The Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

---

## Installation

### Docker Deployment

Docker is the recommended deployment method.

Clone the repository and enter the project directory:

```bash
git clone <REPOSITORY-URL>
cd clearpass-policy-visualiser
```

Start the Visualiser:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Docker Compose builds the Visualiser image and starts the application.

When startup completes, open:

`http://127.0.0.1:5010`

On a new installation, the application starts without initialising the ClearPass caches and presents the Initial Setup page.

To run the Visualiser in the background:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To follow application logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

To stop the Visualiser:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Visualiser configuration and the Flask session secret are stored in the persistent `clearpass-visualiser-data` Docker volume so that configuration survives container replacement.

### Docker Timezone

The container defaults to UTC.

To use another timezone, create a `.env` file in the project directory and set `TZ`. For example:

```text
TZ=Australia/Melbourne
```

This Docker Compose `.env` file is used only for deployment settings such as the container timezone and is separate from the Visualiser `.visualiser.env` configuration created during Initial Setup.

Then start the Visualiser normally:

```bash
docker compose up
```

### Native Python Deployment

Python 3.11 or later is required for a native installation.

```bash
git clone <REPOSITORY-URL>
cd clearpass-policy-visualiser
python -m venv venv
```

#### Windows

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Linux

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies and start the application:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

On a new installation, the application starts without initialising ClearPass caches and presents the Initial Setup page.

---

## Initial Setup

The Initial Setup wizard replaces the previous manual application configuration using `.env` or `config.yaml` process.

### RADIUS Authentication

Configure:

- RADIUS Server
- RADIUS Port
- RADIUS Shared Secret
- Confirm RADIUS Shared Secret
- NAS Identifier

### ClearPass REST API

Configure:

- ClearPass API URL
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Confirm Client Secret
- SSL certificate verification preference

The API client can be found or created under:

```text
Home › Administration › API Services › API Clients
```

### Endpoint Profiling

Endpoint profiling uses the ClearPass PostgreSQL database.

Configure:

- PostgreSQL Host
- PostgreSQL Port
- Database
- Username
- Password
- Confirm Password

The default PostgreSQL username is:

```text
appexternal
```

The `appexternal` password is configured in ClearPass under:

```text
Administration › Server Manager › Server Configuration
› Cluster-Wide Parameters › Database
```
Use the External PostgreSQL Password configured on the Database tab.

Initial Setup validates PostgreSQL connectivity before the configuration can be completed.

### Assisted Configuration Flow

```text
Enable Automatic ClearPass Configuration
        │
        ▼
Enter Visualiser Usernames and Required Passwords
        │
        ▼
Review ClearPass Changes
        │
        ├── Existing
        ├── Would Create
        └── Conflict
        │
        ▼
Save and Continue
        │
        ▼
Run Fresh Server-Side Validation
        │
        ▼
Create Missing ClearPass Objects
        │
        ▼
Verify Provisioned Objects
        │
        ▼
Save .visualiser.env
        │
        ▼
Setup Complete
```

If automatic configuration is not selected, Initial Setup follows the manual ClearPass configuration path and does not create or modify ClearPass objects.

---

## Configuration Files and Secrets

### `.visualiser.env`

Initial Setup creates `.visualiser.env`, which contains active Visualiser configuration and may include:

- ClearPass API Client Secret
- RADIUS Shared Secret
- PostgreSQL password

Do not commit this file to source control. The supplied `.gitignore` excludes it.

ClearPass Local User passwords entered for API-assisted configuration are used only when creating missing users. These passwords are not written to:

- `.visualiser.env`
- the Flask session
- rendered HTML
- provisioning result data
- application logs

Existing matching Local Users are preserved and their passwords are not reset.

### `.flask_secret`

If `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` is not explicitly configured, the application generates a persistent Flask session secret and stores it in `.flask_secret`. This file is excluded from Git.

### Docker Persistent Storage

For Docker deployments, `.visualiser.env` and `.flask_secret` are stored in the persistent `clearpass-visualiser-data` Docker volume.

The persistent volume preserves the Visualiser configuration and Flask session secret when the container is stopped or recreated.

For native Python deployments, these files are stored in the local application directory.

### Correcting Saved Credentials

To correct connection credentials after Initial Setup:

1. Stop Policy Visualiser.
2. Edit `.visualiser.env`.
3. Update the affected value.
4. Ensure the value matches the corresponding ClearPass configuration.
5. Restart Policy Visualiser.

Common values include:

```text
CLEARPASS_CLIENT_SECRET
RADIUS_SECRET
SQL_PASSWORD
```

A restart is required because the Visualiser loads `.visualiser.env` during application startup.

If the RADIUS secret is changed, the value must match the shared secret configured for the Visualiser RADIUS client in ClearPass. If the API Client Secret is changed, the value must match the corresponding ClearPass API Client.

## Starting the Visualiser

### Docker

For an existing configured Docker installation:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Or run in the background:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Native Python

For an existing configured native installation:

```bash
python app.py
```

On subsequent launches with a complete configuration, the Visualiser automatically initialises the caches before starting the web application.

Startup includes:

- ClearPass service discovery
- ClearPass health check
- Endpoint profiling cache
- Role cache
- Enforcement Profile reference cache
- Role Mapping reference cache
- Unused Object cache
- Impact Analysis lookup cache

The Setup Complete page displays an animated loading overlay while the initial cache is being built.

---

## Refreshing Cached Data

The dashboard provides a cache refresh operation which rebuilds Visualiser data from ClearPass, including health, Services, Roles, Enforcement Profile references, Role Mapping references, Unused Object analysis and the Impact Analysis lookup index.

## PostgreSQL Endpoint Profiling Performance

### Reference Results

| Method | Time |
|--------|------|
| REST API | ~74 seconds |
| PostgreSQL | ~0.08 seconds |

The REST API result is retained as a historical performance comparison. ClearPass Policy Visualiser v1.6.0 uses PostgreSQL for endpoint profiling and does not fall back to REST API endpoint profiling.

Reference environment:

```text
Endpoint Profiles: 376
```

These figures are observations from the reference environment and are not guaranteed in other deployments.

---

## Typical Use Cases

- Troubleshooting authentication failures
- Change impact analysis
- ClearPass documentation
- Configuration reviews
- Configuration cleanup
- Endpoint repository and profiling analysis
- Operational knowledge transfer
- Pre-change dependency review for Enforcement Policies and Role Mapping Policies
- Rapid lookup of used, unused and built-in policy objects

---

## Roadmap

Planned enhancements include:

- Administrator-only connection configuration page
- Wider Role-sharing analysis across Role Mapping Policies
- Secure validation and update of saved ClearPass, RADIUS and PostgreSQL connection settings
- Enhanced role-based authorisation controls
- Standalone packaged release
- Multi-server ClearPass support

## Security Considerations

The Visualiser handles credentials used to communicate with ClearPass and PostgreSQL.

Files containing local secrets are excluded from Git, including:

```text
.visualiser.env
.flask_secret
cert.pem
key.pem
```

Administrators should:

- Protect access to the Visualiser host
- Use an appropriately scoped ClearPass API Client
- Protect RADIUS and PostgreSQL credentials
- Use appropriate TLS and certificate verification settings
- Use the read-only ClearPass change review before assisted configuration
- Confirm any object reported as a conflict
- Rotate credentials according to local security policy
- Restart the Visualiser after manually changing `.visualiser.env`
- Never commit `.visualiser.env` or `.flask_secret`

API-assisted configuration never deletes existing ClearPass objects and never automatically replaces conflicting objects.

For Docker deployments:

- The Visualiser container runs as the non-root `visualiser` user.
- The application port is published to `127.0.0.1:5010` by default.
- Persistent configuration is stored in the `clearpass-visualiser-data` Docker volume.
- Sensitive configuration files should remain readable and writable only by the Visualiser user.
